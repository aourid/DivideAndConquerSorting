# DivideAndConquerSorting

The idea here is to implement a simple sorting algorithm (based on the insertion algorithm). Then, by analyzing the number of swaping and number of comparison to acheive the sorting output in function of the dimension of the original array, we can improve a lot the performance of the orignal algorithm by dividing the original array into many sub arrays with very small dimension. The sub arrays are then sorted and merged one by one to generate the final sorted array

This is the same idea as Divide and Conquer paradigms.
